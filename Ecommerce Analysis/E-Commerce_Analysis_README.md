# 📊 E-Commerce Analysis – README

## 📝 Project Description

This project analyzes user behavior on an e-commerce platform to evaluate how effectively the website converts product views into purchases. As a junior data analyst, the primary goal was to examine transaction logs, build a conversion funnel, conduct cohort analysis, and measure customer retention over time.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Construct a **conversion funnel** to track user flow from product views to purchases.
- Create **acquisition cohorts** based on the user's first purchase month.
- Analyze **retention rates** across cohorts to understand user engagement trends.

## 📈 Analysis Overview

### Conversion Funnel
- **Product Views**: 10,453
- **Add to Cart**: 3,036 (29% conversion)
- **Purchases**: 1,081 (10% total conversion)

This highlights a strong drop-off between product views and purchases, especially between cart and checkout.

### Cohort and Retention Analysis
- Acquisition was strongest from **Oct 2020 to Jan 2021**.
- Retention rates fell sharply after the first month for all cohorts.
- By the second month, most cohorts retained fewer than **5%** of users.

## ✅ Key Findings

- The checkout process may be a bottleneck, as many users abandon their carts.
- Users rarely return beyond their first month, indicating low long-term engagement.
- High acquisition rates do not translate into sustained usage or customer loyalty.

## 🔧 Recommendations

- **Optimize the checkout process**: Introduce guest checkout, simplify form steps, and clearly communicate shipping costs.
- **Implement cart recovery strategies**: Use reminder emails and discounts to recover abandoned carts.
- **Improve retention**: Engage users post-purchase via loyalty programs, retargeting, and personalized communication.
- **Collect user feedback**: Identify friction points through surveys or support data.
- **Strengthen onboarding**: Offer welcome incentives and helpful product guides to new users.

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis provided actionable insights into the e-commerce platform’s user journey. While initial engagement is promising, the steep drop in conversions and retention highlights opportunities to improve user experience, streamline the path to purchase, and build long-term customer relationships.
