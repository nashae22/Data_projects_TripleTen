## üîç Analysis  

### 1. Research Questions & Hypotheses

- **RQ4: Which cities are more popular?**  
  *Hypothesis:* Cities offering delivery services are the most popular.

### 2. Data Preparation & Cleaning  
- **Data Collection:**  
  Gathered datasets including customer demographics, order details, restaurant metadata, and customer reviews.

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
  - Removed duplicate records  
  - Addressed missing values  
  - Created calculated columns and DAX measures for enhanced insights

### 3. Key Findings  
- **Dominos** is the most popular and top-selling restaurant across cities.  
- Contrary to expectations, restaurants with **3.5 and 4-star ratings** generated the most sales, not necessarily the highest-rated ones.  
- **Fast food and desserts** dominate the cuisine preferences, not just locally-inspired dishes.  
- **Tirupati** was the city with the highest sales, indicating strong customer demand in that region.  
- A visualization of **sales by rating bin** and **restaurant performance by city** revealed patterns useful for marketing and expansion.

## ‚úÖ Conclusions  
- Ratings do influence sales, but not linearly. Moderate ratings (3.5 to 4 stars) outperform higher ratings in total sales.  
- Dominos‚Äô leading sales performance highlights strong brand preference and operational consistency.  
- Fast food and dessert categories are high performers, cutting across cultural expectations.  
- Tirupati emerges as a strategic location due to its high sales volume.  
- There‚Äôs a gap between customer ratings and purchasing behavior that needs deeper exploration.

## üí° Recommendations  
- **Partner with more fast food and dessert chains** to replicate the sales success of restaurants like Dominos.  
- **Launch targeted marketing campaigns** in both high- and low-performing cities, focusing on high-demand categories.  
- **Develop a customer feedback loop** to analyze why 5-star rated restaurants might not have corresponding sales and improve their strategies.  
- **Enhance city-based targeting** by replicating successful restaurant models from Tirupati in other regions.  
- Consider **experimentation with pricing, promotions, and delivery options** to better align high-rated restaurants with higher sales outcomes.
